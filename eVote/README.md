# üó≥Ô∏è eVote Web Application

**eVote** is a monolithic ASP.NET web application that enables users to register and vote for candidates, respecting specific rules and restrictions around voting behavior.

---

## üöÄ Basic Functionalities

### ‚úÖ User Registration
- Users can register with an email and password.
- Registered users can log in.

### üë§ Account Management
- Users can become candidates or drop out.
- Candidates cannot vote.

### üóÇÔ∏è Voting List
- Publicly accessible.
- Shows how many **valid votes** remain for each user.
- Displays vote count per user.
- Sorted in descending order by number of votes.
- Shows who each user voted for.

### üßæ Voting Rules
- Candidates cannot vote.
- Users must be logged in to vote.
- Max **2 votes per user** (1 per candidate).
- Users can change votes at any time.
- Becoming a candidate keeps previous votes (now invalid).
- Leaving candidacy does not restore past votes‚Äô validity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è About This Project

This is a prototype built in just **4 days**, so it is still in an early stage with limited features, test coverage, and structure. Some `//TODO` comments, unused classes, and failing tests have been intentionally left for future development.

While this doesn‚Äôt reflect production-level standards, it demonstrates how I structure logic and think during fast-paced development.

---

## üîí Server/Client Security Model

Even though the app is monolithic, it mimics a client-server architecture:

- Authentication token is stored in a **cookie**.
- The token is sent with every API request.
- The server validates the token and returns user info.

This setup helps separate client logic from server validation, improving modularity and security.

---

## üõ¢Ô∏è Database

- The app uses **SQLite** (`eVote/eVote.db`) ‚Äî auto-created and pre-populated.
- All users are **single-letter emails** with repeating-letter passwords:

| Email | Password |
|-------|----------|
| `a`   | `aaaa`   |
| `b`   | `bbbb`   |
| `c`   | `cccc`   |
| ...   | ...      |

This makes testing easier and faster.

## üì° API

- The backend API controller is located at:  
  `eVote/Controllers/ApiController.cs`
- Used by the client-side (Razor Pages) to perform authenticated operations.
- **Note:** No Swagger/OpenAPI documentation yet.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

- **Port Binding:**  
  App runs by default on `https://localhost:7152/`.  
  Ports are set in both `launchSettings.json` and `appsettings.json`.  
  You may need to update them manually if port conflicts arise.

- **Cookies:**  
  Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser. The app relies on them for authentication.

- **Testing:**  
  Some tests are incomplete or failing. These were left for future iterations and learning purposes. Priority was given to the development of the application than to the tests

- **Security:**  
  Password validation exists, but since the app is monolithic, **security is weak**. Client and server logic are not truly isolated, so assume limited protection.
